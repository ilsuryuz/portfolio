            <p>I’ve recently made the career pivot to software engineering and am currently completing a coding bootcamp at General Assembly. I am a genius at problem solving and troubleshooting. I love writing code! I attack the logical side first and then move on to the creative aspect of apps. My first few apps have been with a team, which has given me great skills in paired programming and collaboration. I’m thrilled to keep learning and would love to connect!</p>
