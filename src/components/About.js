                I was born and raised in Aktau, Kazakhstan, but now I live near the 3rd most populated city in United States which is Chicago! From an early age, I was interested in computers, I remember myself doing everything with them. Building, breaking, upgrading, you name it. That's why I enrolled in a Software Engineering bootcamp at General Assembly, a program prepared me for the industry and taught me a bunch of skills and technologies which are listed below. I love being able to create an idea of mine, make things better, and even brainstorm problems. Lucky for me, in coding I get to do all of that! Coding is my passion but I like other things as well. I like cars, building, upgrading, and fixing them up. BMW E36 is my most favorite car out there. I also enjoy riding longboards and traveling!
