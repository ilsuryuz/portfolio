                <p>I’ve recently made the career pivot to software engineering
                    and am currently completing a coding bootcamp at General Assembly.
                    I am a genius at problem solving and troubleshooting. I love writing code!
                    I attack the logical side first and then move on to the creative aspect of apps.
                    My first few apps have been with a team, which has given me great skills in paired programming and collaboration.
                    I’m thrilled to keep learning and would love to connect!
