                    I was born and raised in Aktau, Kazakhstan, but now I live near the 3rd most populated city in United States which is Chicago!
                    From an early age I was interested in computers, I remember myself doing everything with them.
                    Building, breaking, upgrading, you name it. In high school Computer Science has caught my eye and since then I really started getting interested in coding!
                    Which is why I recently finished a Software Engineering bootcamp at General Assembly on October 31st, 2022. Which really showed me how software development really is. Prepared me for the industry and taught me a bunch of skills and technologies which are listed below. I love being able to create an idea of mine, make things better, and even brainstorm problmes.
                    Lucky for me in coding I get to do all of that! Coding is my passion but I like other things as well. I like cars, building, upgrading, and fixing them up. BMW E36 is my most favorite car out there.
                    I also enjoy riding longboards and traveling!
